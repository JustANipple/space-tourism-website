## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Framer motion

### What I learned

This time the challenge provided a Figma file to get a more detailed look to the style of each component, so i've been using Figma for the first time. It's very user-friendly to use and i liked it a lot

To make it all more challenging, but adaptive, i used the JSON to create all the components, so adding, removing and updating the "data.json" changes components

For a more professional look, i've implemented animation with the Framer-motion library for the first time. I'm quite satisfied for my first try

### Continued development

I've just scratched the surface of Framer-motion. It has a lot of ways to animate components and i will be tweaking more between all these option
